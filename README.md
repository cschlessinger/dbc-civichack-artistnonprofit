Our app uses the IBM Watson personality analysis tool to analyze mission statements from local artists and nonprofits to suggest creative matches for collaboration. Portions of the grant money that artists receive for their projects will be shared with nonprofits, and the populations that the nonprofits serve will participate in the art installations, perhaps as photography subjects, drawing models, actors, stage hands, or more. Service recipients will have the chance to share their stories via the app and reach a broad audience. Artists' work will reach diverse segments of the population and be eligible for grant money based on the community involvement that their work offers.

I served as the back-end lead, integrating our app with the IBM Watson API and building out the app on Sinatra. Our team produced the app in less than 12 hours.
